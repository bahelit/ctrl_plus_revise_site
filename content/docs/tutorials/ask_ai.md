When using the `Ask AI` keyboard shortcut (Default is: `Alt+A`) or pop-up window you can ask the AI assistant questions. The AI assistant will then use the selected AI model to answer your question.

The `Ask AI` feature does not remember your questions or answers, so you can ask the same question multiple times and get different answers.

{{< tip >}}
The AI has no memory in this mode, so refine your question if you want a different answer.
